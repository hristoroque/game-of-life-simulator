# Requirements

## Introduction

In this document I specify the user requirements in form of user stories, I'll divide this document in two: Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements.

## Functional Requirements

- As a user, I want to run the simulation, so that I can see the evolution of my drawing.

- As a user, I want to pause my simulation, so that I can see a especific generation in detail.

- As a user, I want to draw patterns with the mouse or fingers so that I can simulate my own creations.

- As a user, I want to create random patterns on the grid to see how it evolves.

- As a user, I want to zoom the grid with the scroll wheel or the fingers.

- As a user, I want to have a lot of patterns (creatures) to drag and drop them in the grid

- As a user, I want to take a screenshot of the current generation while it is pause, so that I can have it to share

- As a user, I want to be able to share my pattern in twitter, so that my followers could see it.

- As a user, I want to be able to share my patter in facebook, so that my friends could see it.

## Non functional Requirements

- As a user, I want it to be available on desktop and mobile.

- As a user, I want my drawing to be continuous on the screen so that I can create patterns more easily instead of painting each square.

- As a user, I want to have a huge grid on desktop, so that I can see the simulation in my wide screen.

- As a user, I want to have a small grid on mobile, so that I can see my patterns in my small screen.

- As a user, I want to see a grid and a starter pattern to have an starting point or right away run the simulation.
