# Day 1 - 30/08/2020

Today I start the project. I am going to apply extreme programming and stick to the elements of UX. The first stage of XP is the initial exploration where I identify the first user stories which correspond to the strategy plane of the elements of UX.

The first step is document the user needs and the product objectives in the vision document, and since I am applying XP, I am using the a markdown file for now since I won't need anything more specialized.

With a basic vision document, I started creating the functional requirements and content requirements. Then, the interaction of one functional requirement (draw) and did wireframes and chose the color palette.

About planning, the release will be in two months, and each iteration will have a 2 weeks length. So the firs estimation of this project will be October 25th.

Today I did a quick review of the elements of UX. Now I will implement the basic structure (html) of the pages and see the drawing behavior.

I applied the basic structure in html and was able to draw on the canvas with the mouse (although I had problems with the touch events). Right now my js file is a mess so I need to find a way to structure it, and create some designs for my landing page.
