# Day 3 02/09/2020

Today I watched some videos to use Adobe xd and created the mobile design for the home page and the app (I am naming the index.html as home page because it is a home page and not a landing page).

I added the draw functionality again, but it is spaghetti code so I need to review some books about javascript code organization. If I don't find any object then I will be using the GameLoop Pattern to create that.
